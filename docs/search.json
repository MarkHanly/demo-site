    "text": "Data Analysis\n\nIntroduction\nGreat, let’s get started with some data analysis! In order to explore the relationship between birthweight and other factors we are going to need some data. Luckily, the R ecosystem is chockablock with example datasets, including the birthwt dataset which has ten variables collected on 189 mother-baby pairs The data were originally collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts during 1986.\nThe birthwt dataset, is shipped with the MASS R package, so we will load this first by calling library(MASS). We’ll also load the dplyr package, which has helpful tools for data manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Packages\n\n\n\n\n\nR packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code bundled together in a standardised format. These packages extend the functionality of base R by providing additional tools for specific tasks or domains. R packages can be created by anyone and are typically shared with the R community through platforms like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) or GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr is a popular and highly useful package for data manipulation. Artwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of the R code you would write to load the required packages and view the first few records for the birthwt dataset.\n\nThe library() function loads packages\nThe select() function selects specific variables\nThe head() function prints the first six observations\n\n\nlibrary(MASS) # Includes the birthweight dataset\nlibrary(dplyr) # Tools for manipulating data\n\nbirthwt |&gt; \n  select(age, smoke, ht, bwt) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n   age smoke ht  bwt\n85  19     0  0 2523\n86  33     0  0 2551\n87  20     1  0 2557\n88  21     1  0 2594\n89  18     1  0 2600\n91  21     0  0 2622\n\n\nTo get an idea of the data, we have selected the following four variables:\n\nage Mother’s age in years\nsmoke Smoking status during pregnancy (0=No, 1 = Yes)\nht History of hypertension (0=No, 1 = Yes)\nbwt Birthweight in grams.\n\nLet’s look at a statistical summary of each of these variables. We can do this with the summary() function, as below.\n\nbirthwt |&gt; \n  select(age, smoke, ht, bwt) |&gt; \n  summary()\n\n      age            smoke              ht               bwt      \n Min.   :14.00   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.00000   Min.   : 709  \n 1st Qu.:19.00   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.00000   1st Qu.:2414  \n Median :23.00   Median :0.0000   Median :0.00000   Median :2977  \n Mean   :23.24   Mean   :0.3915   Mean   :0.06349   Mean   :2945  \n 3rd Qu.:26.00   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:0.00000   3rd Qu.:3487  \n Max.   :45.00   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.00000   Max.   :4990  \n\n\nFor example, we can see that in this dataset the median maternal age is 23 years and around 39% of mums smoked during pregnancy.\n\n\nTest your understanding\n\nTrue or False? The oldest maternal age recorded was 40 years? TRUEFALSE\nThe median birthweight was  grams.\n\nLet’s compare the average birthweight among mums who did and did not smoke during pregnancy. One way to do this is to use the group_by() function to group the data by smoking status and then calculate the mean in each group, as below.\n\nbirthwt |&gt; \n  group_by(smoke) |&gt; \n  summarise(mean = mean(bwt))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  smoke  mean\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0 3056.\n2     1 2772.\n\n\nThere is clearly an association between maternal smoking and birthweight. The average birthweight was 3,056 grams for children born to non-smokers compared to 2,772 grams for children born to mums who smoked during pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudying Health Data Science at UNSW\n\n\n\nLearn how to extract actionable insights from health data in HDAT9200 Statistical Foundations for Health Data Science.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive exercise\nNow it’s your turn to try coding! In this interactive exercise, update the code below to calculate the average birthweight among mums who did and did not have a history of hypertension. Remember, history of hypertension is recorded in the variable named ht.\n\nExerciseSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbirthwt |&gt; \n  group_by(ht) |&gt; \n  summarise(mean = mean(bwt))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n     ht  mean\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0 2972.\n2     1 2537.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer the questions below based on the results of your analysis:\nTrue or False? Children born to mothers with a history of hypertension have lower birthweights on average? TRUEFALSE\nThe difference in birthweight between children born to mothers with and without hypertension (to the nearest gram) is  grams."

By crunching numbers and analysing patterns, we gain insights into disease trends, treatment effectiveness, and the factors influencing health outcomes. It’s like having a powerful magnifying glass that allows us to zoom in on the crucial details within a vast dataset.\n\n\n\ncreated by Stable Diffusion\n\n\nEnter the workhorse of statistical modeling – linear regression. At its core, linear regression helps us explore the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Suppose we’re examining the impact of factors like maternal age, smoking, and hypertension on birthweight. Linear regression enables us to quantify these relationships, providing us with coefficients that represent the strength and direction of each influence. It’s like having a mathematical roadmap to understand how changes in one variable correlate with changes in another.\nLet’s take another look at the grouped scatterplot showing birthweight by maternal smoking status. We can see the distribution of birthweight looks to be higher for babies of non-smoking mums compared to smoking mums.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut can we be sure this is the right interpretation? Is the difference meaningful or could it just be noise in the data or random chance? We can fit a linear regression model to quantify the hypothesised relationship between smoking status and birthweight as well as get a sense of the certainty of the estimate.\nBelow is the code to fit a linear model in R using the lm() function. Note that we specify the dependent variable bwt, the independent variable smoke, and the dataset birthwt.\n\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(bwt ~ smoke, data = birthwt)\n\nAnd here are the model results, presented as a table.\n\ntab_model(model1, digits = 0, title = 'Birthweight', show.r2 = FALSE)\n\n\nBirthweight\n\n\n \nbwt\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n3056\n2924 – 3188\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nsmoke\n-284\n-495 – -73\n0.009\n\n\nObservations\n189\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can interpret this as follows:\n\nThe average birthweight among babies born to non-smokers was 3,056 grams.\nThe 95% confidence interval (CI) for this estimate ranges from 2,294 grams to 3,188 grams. This is the range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true population coefficient lies. In other words, if you were to conduct the same study multiple times and calculate a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient for non-smokers each time, you would expect the true coefficient to fall within the range 2,294–3,188 grams in 95% of those intervals.\nThe average birthweight among babies born to smokers was 284 grams less than babies born to non-smokers.\nThe 95% confidence interval (CI) for this estimate ranges from -495 grams to -73 grams.
